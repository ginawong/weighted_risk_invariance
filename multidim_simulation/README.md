Install the requirements using

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tested with Python 3.7.5.

To generate the simulated data experiment from the paper, run

```bash
/bin/bash generate_figure.sh
```

This will generate results in a local `results` directory and plot a figure at `results/multidim_sim.pdf`.
